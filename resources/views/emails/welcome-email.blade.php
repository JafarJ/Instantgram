# Welcome to Instantgram

Have fun with the bootleg Facebook daughter app.

Disclaimer, this is not the official Instagram app, if it´s not already obvious enough, cringe.

If you´re interested in how this works everything is on <a href="#">Github</a>, download it, play with it, make your own version, like said, have fun!

By the way this was made through the FreeCodeCamp.org tutorial on Laravel.
